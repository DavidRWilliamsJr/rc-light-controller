# RC Crawler Light Controller

An Arduino-based, feature-rich light controller for a custom RC crawler.

## Project Goal
To develop a custom, PCB-based light controller using an Arduino Nano Every. The system will manage standard and addressable LEDs based on RC inputs and sensor data, with a non-blocking, state-machine-based software architecture.

## Key Features
-   Brake, reverse, and turn signal lights based on RC channel inputs.
-   Automatic headlights/tail lights via a photocell.
-   Hazard lights linked to a transmission servo channel.
-   Underbody "rock lights" that flash red under high motor current.
-   Multiple, user-selectable lighting modes.

## Current Status
-   **Hardware:** Provisional plan complete. Awaiting acquisition of a suitable 3S-rated 5V UBEC.
-   **Software:** Initial code framework and pin definitions are established.
-   **Next Step:** Transcribe project history and begin development of core logic functions.
